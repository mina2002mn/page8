                    been
                    the subject of various literary and cinematic treatments.

                    The Birth of Venus (Italian: Nascita di Venere [ˈnaʃʃita di ˈvɛːnere]) is a painting by the Italian
                    artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving
                    at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene
                    and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.</p>
